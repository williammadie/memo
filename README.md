# Memo

Hey you, welcome to my memo! You're currently looking at my lessons' and personal notes about computer science and related topics.

I hope you'll find what you're looking for :)

## How to use me

- Browse files and read only markdown files (ending with `.md`)
- Files are organized in topics and I do my best to maintain a coherent structure.
- All topics are structured the same way:

```bash
nlp/                    <-- The name of the topic
├── nlp.md              <-- The topic's cheatsheet
└── resources/          <-- The folder containing images
    ├── stemming-vs-lemmatization.png
    └── stopwords.png
```
