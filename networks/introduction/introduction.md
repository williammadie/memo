## OSI Model

The **Open Systems Interconnection Model** is a conceptual model that standardizes the telecommunications at different layers. It was developed in the 1970s because of the numerous diverse computer networking methods. The idea was to homogenize/standardize these methods at a large scale.

The **OSI Model** is a seven-layer model where layers belong to two different classes. Layers from **1 to 3** are called the ***Media layers** and layers from **4 to 7** are called the ***Host layers***
