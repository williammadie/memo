## Useful commands 
### Query on a linux filesystem

Search for a file in a folder and all its subdirectories
```bash
find . -name 'nom_fichier_Ã _chercher'
```
(The . refers to the current locatiton/directory)

Search a specific text in a file:
```bash
grep -rnw 'PATH' -e 'mon_texte'
```
Options used here:
- -r recursive search from the given `PATH`
- -n show the line number in the file
- -w match the whole word
- -e pattern use during the search

See how many files are present in a directory
```bash
ls | wc -l
```

See how many files are present in a directory and in its subdirectories
```bash
find . -type f | wc -l
```

### Storage related commands

See the **size of a folder**:
(the **max-depth** option is used to avoid recursive behaviors)
```bash
du -h --max-depth=1.
```

See the **storage capacity of the server**:
```bash
df -h
```


## Shortcuts

- Switch to another desktop: `CTRL` + `ALT` + `ARROW`
- Pass a window on the second screen: `WINDOWS` + `SHIFT` + `ARROW`

## The legendary VIM Editor

### Differences between VIM and VI

VIM is a text editor built on top of VI. It litteraly means **VI iMproved**. VIM offers a lot more features than VI. It is also more used than VI because it is a free text editor (free as a speech)


### Commands

```bash
vim fileIwant2edit
#or
vi fileIwant2edit
```

Inside vim, you can easily get panicked once you've realised there is **no
easy escape**. You start to think that your computer is evil and lured you into this trap. But don't worry, it is not the case ! Here are the commands that will save your life:

- Look for a word or several words in the file:
`/` + `pattern`

- `i` : Switch to the edition mode
- `V` : Select the whole line
- `Y` : Copy
- `P` : Paste
- `ESCP` + `:wq!` : Save and exit
- `ESCP` + `:q!` : Exit without saving

Only in VIM:

- `:e` : Open a new file
- `:b` : Switch to another opened file
- `:se nonu` : Hide line numbers
- `:se nu` : Show line numbers

### Config

It is possible to add functionalities to the Vim Editor by changing settings 
inside the `.vimrc` file. (In most cases, it is not present by default and you
have to create it in `~/.vimrc`)

## Scripts

### Bash basics

#### Basic commands

Identify which *type of Shell* you're using. Here you're using Bash
```bash
$ which $SHELL
/bin/bash
```

Sleep for a given amount of time
```bash
$ sleep 4
```

#### Structure of a Bash script

Any bash script is required to start the same way. First, we have to indicate
which executable is being used to read the following script. Then, we'll check
if the user has specified the correct number of arguments.
```bash
#! /bin/bash

if [ $# != 3 ]
then
    echo "SYNTAXE: bash $0 ARG1 ARG2 ARG3"
    return 1
else
    # Do a job
fi
```

#### Conditions

**Arithmetic operators**
- `-eq` : is equal to
- `-ne` : is not equal to
- `-gt` : is greater than
- `-ge` : is greater than or equal to
- `-lt` : is less than
- `-le` : is less than or equal to

**String operators**

- `==` : is equal to
- `!=` : is not equal to
- `-z` : is null
- `-n` : is not null
- `=~` : contains a pattern (Support for REGEX)

**Structure of IF**

```bash
if CONDITION1
then
    RESPONSE1
elif CONDITION2
then
    RESPONSE2
else
    RESPONSE3
fi
```

**Structure of SWITCH CASE**

```bash
case $variable in 

    CASE1)
    echo 'Case1'
    ;;

    CASE2)
    echo 'Case2'
    ;;

    CASE3)
    echo 'Case3'
    ;;

    *)
    echo 'Default'
    exit 1
    ;;
esac
```

Testing if an integer equals 4 or 5
```bash
if [ $val -eq 4 ] || [ $val -eq 5 ]
then
    echo "Error: Not equal to 4 or 5"
fi
```

Testing if a string equals 'start' or 'stop'
```bash
if [ $val == 'start' ] || [ $val == 'stop' ]
then
    echo "Error: Not equal to 'start' or 'stop'"
fi
```

#### String operations

**Lower a string**
```bash
lower_str=$(echo "$str2lower" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
```

### Executing a script & Sourcing a script

|              Executing (bash or ./process or process)             |              Sourcing (source or . process)              |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------:|
| runs the commands in **a new shell process** which is then closed | runs the commands in **the current shell process**       |
| **does not change the environment** in the current running shell  | **changes the environment** in the current running shell |
