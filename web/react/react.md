## Introduction

React is library created by a Facebook engineer in 2013. It is usually refered as a framework but it is not because it does not naturally handle routing. It needs other libraries in order to handle routing. Nowadays, it is one of the most popular library for Web Development alongside Angular.

React is loved because it is very **modular** and modularity allows reusability of components. Its **JSX** syntax is very powerful and it is **widely used** so it is linked to a lot of professional opportunities.

## Start a React Project

### Prerequisite

React SPAs use `npm` (=**Node Package Manager**). It is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects.

Install npm
```bash
sudo apt install npm
```

Check npm installation
```bash
npm -v
```

React SPAs also use `node`. Node is an open source development pltaform for executing JavaScript code server-side.

Install node
```bash
sudo apt install nodejs
```

Check node installation
```bash
node -v
```

### Use a toolchain

`Create React App` is a **toolchain** (=an environment for React). It is the best way to start building a new SPA in React:

Create and start a basic React App with NPX (=**NPM Script Environment/Utility**)
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
