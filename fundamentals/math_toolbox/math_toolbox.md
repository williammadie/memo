## Bijection

**Bijection** is an operation which links elements of two sets exactly **one-to-one**. For instance, let say that we need to organize a Secret Santa. Each person among the participants needs to be associated to a single person. So, we have the following set:

```python
participants = ['Emma', 'John', 'Pauline', 'Sam', 'Linda', 'Scott']
```

First, we can duplicate it to make things clearer:
```python
givers = ['Emma', 'John', 'Pauline', 'Sam', 'Linda', 'Scott']
receivers = ['Emma', 'John', 'Pauline', 'Sam', 'Linda', 'Scott']
```
